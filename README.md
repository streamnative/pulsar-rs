[![docs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/pulsar)](https://docs.rs/pulsar)

This is a pure Rust client for Apache Pulsar that does not depend on the C++ Pulsar library. It provides an async/await based API, compatible with [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) and [async-std](https://async.rs/).

Features:

- URL based (`pulsar://` and `pulsar+ssl://`) connections with DNS lookup;
- Multi topic consumers (based on a regex or list);
- TLS connection;
- Configurable executor (Tokio or async-std);
- Automatic reconnection with exponential back off;
- Message batching;
- Compression with LZ4, zlib, zstd or Snappy (can be deactivated with Cargo features);
- Telemetry using [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) crate (can be activated with Cargo features).

## Getting Started

Add the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
futures = "0.3"
pulsar = "5.1"
tokio = "1.0"
```

Try out [examples](examples):

- [producer](examples/producer.rs)
- [consumer](examples/consumer.rs)
- [reader](examples/reader.rs)
