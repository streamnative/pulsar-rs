[Documentation](https://docs.rs/pulsar)

This is a pure Rust client for Apache Pulsar that does not depend on the C++ Pulsar library. It provides an async/await based API, compatible with [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) and [async-std](https://async.rs/).

Features:

- URL based (`pulsar://` and `pulsar+ssl://`) connections with DNS lookup
- multi topic consumers (based on a regex or list)
- TLS connection
- configurable executor (Tokio or async-std)
- automatic reconnection with exponential back off
- message batching
- compression with LZ4, zlib, zstd or Snappy (can be deactivated with Cargo features)
- telemetry using [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) crate (can be activated with Cargo features)

### Getting Started
